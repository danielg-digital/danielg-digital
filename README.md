I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a diverse background in transportation, customer service, and operations. Over the past seven years, I have honed strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and a dedication to reliability in fast-paced, client-focused environments. Currently transitioning into cybersecurity, I am building hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and security automation, leveraging both my analytical mindset and technical training to protect systems and data.

## Objective
With over seven years of experience in customer service, transportation, and operational roles, I bring strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a commitment to reliability. Leveraging my background in managing complex schedules, safety protocols, and client-focused operations, I am now transitioning into cybersecurity, where I can combine my analytical mindset and technical training to protect systems and data. My goal is to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, contributing to threat detection, incident response, and the continuous improvement of organizational security posture.
