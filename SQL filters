Apply filters to SQL queries

Project description
Discovery of potential security issues that involve login attempts and updating employee machines. Through SQL we will attempt to find all security events and filter them to specific days, locations and departments.
Retrieve after hours failed login attempts

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time >= '18:00' AND success = 'FALSE';

This outputs the after hours failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00, which shows a suspicious event on 2022-05-09.

Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
To investigate I will review all login attempts that occurred on 2922-05-09 or 2022-05-08.

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = login_date '2022-05-09' OR login_date = login_date '2022-05-08';
Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
Suspicious activity was then found to exclude Mexico (Mex%), so I excluded (Mex%) from the query.

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE NOT country = 'Mex%';

This query searches all after hours login attempts NOT originating in Mexico.

Retrieve employees in Marketing
Now our team wantst to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department with an office location of East

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office = 'East%';

This query results in showing only machines from the Marketing dept. in the East building by using the AND filter to include both the Marketing and office categories

Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales' OR 'Finance'; 

This query results in showing only machines in the Sales and Finance departments by using the OR filter to include both Sales and Finance parameters.


Retrieve all employees not in IT
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';

this query results in showing all employees NOT in Information Technology because I excluded all IT employees by using the NOT filter

Summary
Upon discovery of potential security issues that involve login attempts and updating employee machines our team began with a SQL query searching for all login attempts after hours. A possible security incident was noted on 2022-05-09, so we investigated 2022-05-09 & 2022-05-08 for more information. It was then noted no after hour logins were from Mexico.  Next we performed security updates on employee machines in Marketing located in the East building. Then we performed 
A query for employee machines in the Sales and Finance departments that needed updates was done. And lastly all Information Technology employees were excluded from the last query.
